# Classes

AD&D 2nd edition is a role-playing game that allows you to create and play characters of various races and classes in a fantasy world. Classes are the main categories that define your character's abilities, skills, and role in the game. There are four main groups or "metaclasses" of classes: Warrior, Wizard, Priest, and RogueÂ¹. Each metaclass has several subclasses that offer different specializations and options.

Here is a brief overview of each metaclass and subclass:

**Warrior**: Warriors are skilled in combat and physical prowess. They can use any weapon and armor, and have the highest hit points and attack bonuses. They also gain followers at high levels. The subclasses of Warrior are:

- **Fighter**: Fighters are the most versatile and adaptable warriors. They can specialize in a weapon type, gaining extra attacks and bonuses with it. They can also become weapon masters, gaining extraordinary abilities with their chosen weapon.
- **Ranger**: Rangers are warriors who live in harmony with nature. They can use any weapon and light armor, and have some skills in tracking, stealth, and survival. They also have some limited spellcasting ability from the priest sphere of Animal, Plant, or Elemental. They can specialize in fighting certain types of enemies, such as giants or undead, gaining bonuses against them.
- **Paladin**: Paladins are holy warriors who serve a good-aligned deity. They can use any weapon and armor, and have some skills in healing, detecting evil, and turning undead. They also have some limited spellcasting ability from the priest sphere of Healing or Protection. They must follow a strict code of conduct, or risk losing their powers.

**Wizard**: Wizards are masters of arcane magic. They can use only a few weapons and no armor, and have the lowest hit points and attack bonuses. They must study and memorize spells from spellbooks, which they can learn from scrolls or other sources. They can also create magic items and research new spells. The subclasses of Wizard are:

- **Mage**: Mages are the most general and flexible wizards. They can learn spells from any of the eight schools of magic: Abjuration, Alteration, Conjuration/Summoning, Divination, Enchantment/Charm, Illusion/Phantasm, Invocation/Evocation, and Necromancy. However, they must choose one school to be their specialty, gaining extra spells from it, and two schools to be their opposition, which they cannot learn at all.
- **Specialist**: Specialists are wizards who focus on one school of magic to the exclusion of others. They gain more spells and abilities from their chosen school, but they cannot learn spells from two or more opposition schools. There are eight types of specialists: Abjurer (Abjuration), Transmuter (Alteration), Conjurer (Conjuration/Summoning), Diviner (Divination), Enchanter (Enchantment/Charm), Illusionist (Illusion/Phantasm), Invoker (Invocation/Evocation), and Necromancer (Necromancy).
- **Illusionist**: Illusionists are a special type of specialist wizard who focus on the school of Illusion/Phantasm. They have some differences from other specialists, such as being able to use daggers and darts as weapons, having a different spell progression table, and being able to multi-class with thieves.

**Priest**: Priests are servants of divine powers. They can use only certain weapons and armor, depending on their faith, and have moderate hit points and attack bonuses. They do not need to memorize spells; instead, they pray for them each day from their deity's sphere of influence. They can also perform miracles such as healing wounds, curing diseases, or turning undead. The subclasses of Priest are:

- **Cleric**: Clerics are the most common and versatile priests. They can use any blunt weapon and any armor,
